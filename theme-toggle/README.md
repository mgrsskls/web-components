## Theme Toggle

- Creates inputs for `auto`, `light` and `dark`.
- Stores the selection in `localStorage` (if it is not `auto`) and selects the correct input on upcoming page loads.
- Can use Light DOM instead of markup generated by the Web Component.

## Options

### `themes`

If you want to toggle between more than `auto`, `light` and `dark` themes, you can use `themes` property. The value should be a space separate list of theme names.

### `name`

By default, the `name` of the input elements is `theme` (or `theme-{n}` if you have more than on `theme-toggle` on a page).
You can change this by using the `name` attribute.

## Usage

Please checkout these examples on how to use the Web Component.

## Applying a theme

Please note that this Web Component does not add any classes or attributes to the DOM.

Instead you can `:has()` to apply the correct theme to your page. Please check out this blog post for an example: https://www.mgrossklaus.de/notes/2023-02-04-implementing-a-theme-toggle-with-html-and-css-only-almost/.
